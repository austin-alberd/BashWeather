A simple command line weather app written in bash.

This was created for an assignment in CSC-2510 Intro To Devops with Unix at Tennessee Tech.

This project uses ![Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) to get weather data and ![ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to get location data based on your IP.

The tool displays basic weather information based on your location (pulled from your IP). The emojis change depending on the weather.
